organizing code tips and tricks


Thus far, Ive used mainly folders in my computer, email, and google drive to organize code.

TIPS & TRICKS
1) when adding code to a personal computer drive, keep number of folders to a minimum and label them with short, obvious names.
2) When using google drive, keep personal and public or group drive folders strictly seperate with edited code files. Also, if you have a handful of code files for one project, keep them all in one folder clearly labeled with that project name, inside of another folder used for code files in general.
For example, i have a folder in google drive named BtM with folder inside BtM labeled "mfiles", which then has seperate folders inside of that labeled for each lab.
